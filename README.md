I do not claim ownership on this code and you are free to copy paste it and use it (although, it may not work as intended depending on your goals). The code in this repository is for learning purposes and is based on the work of many Quant reseashers and coding forums. For French speakers : "Nous sommes des nains sur des épaules de géants".
